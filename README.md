# redash-in-js
Redash in JavaScript - run query in multiple envs

## Getting Started

1. Clone
2. move to node version that found in the `.nvmrc` file
3. copy `env.example.js` to `env.js`
4. Set the urls, token (token can be found in the profile page in redash) and data source id
5. run `npm i`
6. run `node index.js "<query>"`


> In case you have other envs you need to change throughout the code (In the future I want to make it configurable)


------

I need to publish this as an NPM package, I'll try to do it when I have time
